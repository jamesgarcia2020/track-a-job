# Track-A-Job
##### My app can be used to track the most important jobs that you are trying to apply for.  This app will allow you to focus on the jobs that you are making traction with.  You can use spreadsheets to track all the jobs you are applying for.  Track-A-Job lets you focus on those jobs you are most passionate about getting and those jobs that are serious about you.
